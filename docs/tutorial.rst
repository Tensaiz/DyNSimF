This section will describe the main modeling flow and the relevant concepts that will appear.
After following this section, it will be clear on how to implement your own model, or run one of the examples.

The main goal of this framework, is to create an environment where a network model, whether static or dynamic can be created.
Nodes inside a network can have multiple states that can be updated based on certain conditions. Next to this, the edges can also be updated.

----------------------
General modeling steps
----------------------

The general modeling flow is as follows:

1. Define a graph
2. Add (continuous) internal states
3. Define constants and intial values
4. Create update conditions
5. Add iteration schemes (optional)
6. Create a utility/cost layer (optional)

    a. Define a utility and cost
    b. Choose an iteration method
    c. Choose a sample method

7. Simulate
8. Optional steps(Visualize/Sensitivity analysis)

By following these steps, almost any network that relies on state updating using conditions can be created and simulated.

------------------------------------
Graph, internal states and constants
------------------------------------

The graphs should be ``Networkx`` graphs, either defined by yourself or generated using one of their built-in functions.
Attributes in the graph can still be accessed and used to update functions.

After a graph is defined, the model can be initialized and internal states can be added to the model. The model constructor takes in a ``ModelConfiguration`` object,
which functions as a config. This object can be used to specify what information should be saved / written to disk.

When the model is initalized,
states can be added using ``set_states([state1, state2, state3, ..., stateN])`` function, where the argument is a list containing strings indicating the states.

If the model requires certain constant values, these can be added by setting them manually.
It should be a dictionary where the key corresponds to the constant name and the value to the constant value.
Adding constants is completely optional.

Example:


.. code-block:: python

    import networkx as nx
    from dynsimf.models.Model import Model
    from dynsimf.models.Model import ModelConfiguration

    # Create an initial graph
    g = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n=1000, p=0.1)

    # Create the constants dictionary
    constants = {
        'constant_1': 0.1,
        'constant_2': 2.5
    }

    cfg = ModelConfiguration() # A configuration object for the model
    model = Model(g, ModelConfiguration(cfg)) # Initialize a model object
    model.constants = constants # Set the constants
    model.set_states(['state1', 'state2']) # Add the states to the model


-------------
Intial values
-------------

After the graph has been created, the model has been initalized, and the internal states have been added,
the next step is to define the intial values of the states.

This is done by creating a dictionary, that maps a state name to a list of initial values per node, or a constant value.
This value has to be a continous value, that can be statically set, or it can be a function that will return a list of all the initial values.

After creating the dictionary, it can be added to the model using the ``set_initial_state(initial_dict, param_dict)`` function.
The param_dict argument is a dictionary that specifies which input the functions inside the initial_dict should receive as parameters.

The example below will create a model with 3 states. Every node in the model will initialize `status_1` with a value returned by the `initial_status_1` function,
which will results in all nodes getting a random uniform value between 0 and 0.5. The same happens for the internal state `status_2`.
The third state is constant and thus the same for every node.

.. code-block:: python

    import networkx as nx
    import numpy as np
    from dynsimf.models.Model import Model

    constants = {
        'x': 0.2,
        'N', 100
    }

    # Returns constants[N] amount of random numbers between 0 and 0.5
    def initial_state_1(constants):
        return np.random.uniform(0, 0.5, constants['N'])

    # Returns constants[N] amount of random numbers between 0.5 and 1 + constants[x] (0.2)
    def initial_state_2(constants):
        return constants['x'] + np.random.uniform(0.5, 1, constants['N'])

    initial_states = {
        'state_1': initial_state_1, # A function returning initial values for every node for their state 1
        'state_2': initial_state_2, # A function returning initial values for every node for their state 2
        'state_3': 2 # A constant
    }

    g = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n=100, p=0.1)

    model = Model(g)
    model.constants = constants
    model.add_states['state_1', 'state_2', 'state_3']

    # The paramaters we want to receive in our initalization functions
    initial_params = {
        'constants': model.constants
    }
    model.set_initial_state(initial_state, initial_params)

-------
Updates
-------

In progress...

-----------------
Update conditions
-----------------

Another important part of the model is creating conditions and update rules. There are multiple levels a condition could apply to, these levels can be selected using the ConditionType class:

    - State: A condition based on a node's state
    - Adjacency: Condition based on the number of neighbors of a node
    - Utility: A condition based on the current utility of the node
    - Edge values: A custom condition based on the edge values between nodes

Next to that, there are multiple ways of evaluating whether a condition is True:

    - StochasticCondition: Takes in a number and makes a random draw, if the number is smaller than the argument, it will satisfy the condition.
    - ThresholdCondition: A condition to check whether a value specified using ConditionType, is greater than, greater or equal than, lesser than, lesser or equal than a certain value.
    - Custom: A custom condition that could be anything based on the values in the framework

In the example below, the states are updated when the condition ``NodeStochastic(1)`` is true, which is always the case, so the update functions are called every iteration.
Here the state `state_1` will be updated every iteration by setting it equal to `state_2` + 0.1. The same is done for `state_2`, but in this case it is set equal to `state_1` + 0.5.
As can be seen in the example, the states can be retrieved using the function ``get_state(state_name)``.

.. code-block:: python

    import networkx as nx
    import numpy as np
    from dynsimf.models.Model import Model

    from dynsimf.models.components.conditions.Condition import ConditionType
    from dynsimf.models.components.conditions.StochasticCondition import StochasticCondition

    g = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n=100, p=0.1)

    model = Model(g)

    model.add_states(['state_1', 'state_2']

    # Conditions
    s = StochasticCondition(ConditionType.STATE, 1)

    # Update functions
    def update_1():
        return {'state_1': model.get_state('state_2') + 0.1}

    def update_2():
        return {'state_2': model.get_state('state_1') + 0.5}

    # Rules
    model.add_update(update_1, condition=s)
    model.add_update(update_2, condition=s)

-----------------
Iteration schemes
-----------------

Another addition to the model, are iteration schemes. These can be used for two things:

1. Specify nodes to update
2. Specify iteration range when updates should take place

This allows to only update a select amount of nodes during a specific time in the iteration.
Under the hood, when schemes are not defined,
a default scheme is used for every rule that is active during each iteration and selects all nodes.

To create a scheme, simply define a list where each element is a dictionary containing the following keys:

	- name: maps to a string that indicates the name of the scheme
	- function: maps to a function that returns the nodes that should be updated if a condition is true. Its arguments are:

		- graph: the full networkx graph
		- status: A status dictionary that maps a node to a dictionary with State -> Value mappings

	- lower (optional): maps to an integer indicating from which iteration the scheme should apply
	- upper (optional): maps to an integer indicating until which iteration the scheme should apply

After the scheme dictionary is created, it can be added to the model when the model is initalized:
``ContinuousModel(graph, constants=constants, iteration_schemes=schemes)``.

Furthermore, if rules are added using the ``add_rule`` function, it should now be done as follows:
``model.add_rule('state_name', update_function, condition, scheme_list)``.
Here a rule can be added to multiple schemes. The scheme_list is a list, where every element should match a name of a scheme,
which means that updates can be done in multiple schemes.
If a scheme_list is not provided, the rule will be executed for every iteration, for every node, if the condition is true.

In the example below, the previous model is executed in the same manner,
but this time, the update_1 function is only being evaluated when ``lower â‰¤ iteration < upper``,
in this case when the iterations are equal or bigger than 100 but lower than 200.
Furthermore, if the condition is true, the update function is then only executed for the nodes returned by the function specified in the scheme.
In this case a node is selected based on the weighted `status_1` value.
Because no scheme has been added to the second rule, it will be evaluated and executed for every node, each iteration.


.. code-block:: python

    import networkx as nx
    import numpy as np
    from ndlib.models.ContinuousModel import ContinuousModel
    import ndlib.models.ModelConfig as mc

    g = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n=1000, p=0.1)

    # Define schemes
    def sample_state_weighted(graph, status):
        probs = []
        status_1 = [stat['status_1'] for stat in list(status.values())]
        factor = 1.0/sum(status_1)
        for s in status_1:
            probs.append(s * factor)
        return np.random.choice(graph.nodes, size=1, replace=False, p=probs)

    schemes = [
        {
            'name': 'random weighted agent',
            'function': sample_state_weighted,
            'lower': 100,
            'upper': 200
        }
    ]

    model = ContinuousModel(g, iteration_schemes=schemes)

    model.add_status('status_1')
    model.add_status('status_2')

    # Compartments
    condition = NodeStochastic(1)

    # Update functions
    def update_1(node, graph, status, attributes, constants):
        return status[node]['status_2'] + 0.1

    def update_2(node, graph, status, attributes, constants):
        return status[node]['status_1'] + 0.5

    # Rules
    model.add_rule('status_1', update_1, condition, ['random weighted agent'])
    model.add_rule('status_2', update_2, condition)


----------
Simulation
----------

After everything has been specified and added to the model, it can be ran using the ``iteration_bunch(iterations)`` function.
It will run the model iterations amount of times and return the regular output as shown in other models before.
